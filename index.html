    <p>[Verse 1]<br>
    I'll be your mirror<br>
    Reflect what you are, in case you don't know<br>
    I'll be the wind, the rain, and the sunset<br>
    The light on your door to show that you're home</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    When you think the night has seen your mind<br>
    That inside, you're twisted and unkind<br>
    Let me stand to show that you are blind<br>
    Please put down your hands<br>
    'Cause I see you</p>

    <p>[Verse 2]<br>
    I find it hard to believe you don't know<br>
    The beauty you are<br>
    But if you don't, let me be your eyes<br>
    A hand to your darkness so you won't be afraid</p>

    <p>[Chorus]<br>
    When you think the night has seen your mind<br>
    That inside, you're twisted and unkind<br>
    Let me stand to show that you are blind<br>
    Please put down your hands<br>
    'Cause I see you</p>

    <p>[Outro]<br>
    I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)<br>
    I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)<br>
    I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)<br>
    I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)</p>

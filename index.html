  <h1>"I'll Be Your Mirror"</h1>

  <p>[Verse 1]<br>
  I'll be your mirror<br>
  Reflect what you are, in case you don't know<br>
  I'll be the wind, the rain, and the sunset<br>
  The light on your door to show that you're home</p>

  <p>[Chorus]<br>
  When you think the night has seen your mind<br>
  That inside, you're twisted and unkind<br>
  Let me stand to show that you are blind<br>
  Please put down your hands<br>
  'Cause I see you</p>

  <p>[Verse 2]<br>
  I find it hard to believe you don't know<br>
  The beauty you are<br>
  But if you don't, let me be your eyes<br>
  A hand to your darkness so you won't be afraid</p>

  <p>[Chorus]<br>
  When you think the night has seen your mind<br>
  That inside, you're twisted and unkind<br>
  Let me stand to show that you are blind<br>
  Please put down your hands<br>
  'Cause I see you</p>

  <p>[Outro]<br>
  I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)<br>
  I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)<br>
  I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)<br>
  I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)</p>
